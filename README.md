# Dividend Yield and Stock Price Volatility: Evidence from Dhaka Stock Exchange
During my undergrad, I worked on a research paper titled "Dividend Yield and Stock Price Volatility: Evidence from Dhaka Stock Exchange" under supervision Dr. Mahmood Osman Imam.
This was my first time working with financial data and applying econometrics models to test hypothesis using statistical software "Stata".

This study examined if Dividend Yield is a significant determinant of Stock Price Volatility of non-financial firms listed in Dhaka Stock Exchange. Data of 75 companies from seven different industries were used from year 2014 to 2018, with exception in stock price, earnings per share, and total asset data; the first two variables required data from 2012 to 2018, and the last one from 2013 to 2018. 

The study was conducted taking Dividend Yield as the explanatory variable and Earnings Volatility, Long-term debt, Firm size, and Asset growth as control variables. We also used dividend payout as the explanatory variable in other models because dividend yield and dividend payout are highly correlated. We used Panel regression analysis to conduct the research, and used Fixed Effects Model using Stata 16. According to Hausman test, Fixed effects model rather than Random Effects Model is appropriate.
